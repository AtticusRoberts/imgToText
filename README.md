# imgToText
An algrithm that converts and image to a bunch of text.
It's written in processing, so you'll need to have that IDE downloaded to run it. You can get the IDE at processing.org. 
It has to be in the same folder as the image for it to work; all the specifics of how to run it on different images are commented in the code.
It has two outputs, one that shows up in a new window, which you can't copy and paste, and another that shows up in the console bit of the IDE, right at the bottom, which you can copy and paste.
You can also choose how small the text is and how clear the image is by messing with the scl variable, which I also go a little more in depth about in my code. 
That's pretty much it! Enjoy!
